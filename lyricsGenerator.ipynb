    "Nowadays, natural language processing (NLP), especially language models, are all around us. Without learning language or defining fixed rules it is pretty amazing how well they can generate new content also including art. This is a hotly debated topic [Towards Science: AI Art Debate](https://towardsdatascience.com/the-ai-art-debate-excitement-fear-and-ethics-c04d30f338da). Besides the ethical discussion, language models open up a large field of use cases. For example in combination with data sources containing lyrics, songs could be generated. The aim of this project work is to analyze songs from one specific artist and try to generate more lyrics which could be sold as new songs. Not only the simple generation would be interesting, but also how to generate ryhmes by using an Markov Chains."

This can be tricky for lyrics generation, because sometimes for ryhme purposes a new word can be created or a word from another language can be used. Even though I don't think that this model is able to create new words, it would be better to use the character-based approach.\n",

    "## Conclusion and Further work\n",
    "Markov Chains are a great way to generate text language independent. Two big advantages by using this method are that there is no need for large input data and that the compution time for the model is very short. I think it is quite amazing how fast a language model can learn about sentences and grammar. \\\n",
    "By looking at our results, the model was able to use line breaks which structures our generated lyrics very well. Nevertheless, there is lots of room for improvement. One can hardly find ryhmes in the text and there is no context in the song text. \\\n",
    "One approach would be to change the hyperparamter *k* to get more related text lines. It is questionable whether by using larger character groups already existing phrases of songs will be reused as a result. Another idea would be to investigate more time in the preprocessing. One could analyze the ryhmes of the existing songs and select only unison rhymes as input text. I think that double rhymes or cross rhymes confuses the model because the connection of the text lines are too far apart. \\\n",
    "To sum up, I am happy with the result and I think that with more preprocessing or hyperparameter tuning a language model could rap like Eminem. Even if it takes a lot more than rhymes to create new songs."
